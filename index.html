    <p>
      I am clergy man in my field of calling and passion. A resident minister in
      my called vineyard, driving the kingdom of God on earth. I am also a
      passionate person for tech right from my teenage age. This has driven my
      interest to keep looking forward to embrace any technology information.
      What has inspired me about this tech, is the futuristic impact it will
      make in our present and future to come. and to avoid to be left behind. I
      have developed keen interest and passion to grap every knowledge from this
      direction and to be well equiped for the future. This has driven my
      passion and inspiration to go into coding. And today, I have passionately
      enrolled into the class and to further inquire more knowlwdge in this
      aspect as time permits me.
